# EPIC-SOUNDS Dataset

We introduce [EPIC-SOUNDS](https://epic-kitchens.github.io/epic-sounds/), a large scale dataset of audio annotations capturing temporal extents and class labels within the audio stream of the egocentric videos from EPIC-KITCHENS-100. EPIC-SOUNDS includes 79.2k segments of audible events and actions, distributed across 44 classes. In this repository, we provide labelled temporal timestamps for the train / val split, and just the timestamps for the recognition test split. We train and evaluate two state-of-the-art audio recognition models on our dataset, which we also provide the code and pretrained models.
